# ASCII-Obfuscation-KeyValue-Generator
This code generates a key-value set for a substitution cipher using all ASCII text characters (32-126)

I mostly posted this for those who are curious how I did key-value obfuscation in my current primary project, <a href="https://github.com/LordGiacomoS/AO3-Item-Manager">AO3 Item Manager</a>, since the file there is compiled to improve security slightly.
